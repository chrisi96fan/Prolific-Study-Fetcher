Hello the goal of this program is to automatically open studies on the website prolific and reserve a spot with the help of ui automation.
This is more meant as a personal project since some of the parameters are fairly customized (like the ui automation coordinates used with pyautogui) but everyone.
The required libraries are contained in the requirements.txt file and can be installed with the follwoing command pip install -r requirements.txt   in a terminal window.
